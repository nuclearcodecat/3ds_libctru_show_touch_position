# 3ds_show_touch_position
 homebrew for the 3ds that displays the touchscreen's position

the code is very simple with no real error checking

if you'd like to try this out on your console, make sure that you set the SCR_BOTTOM_W and SCR_BOTTOM_H variables to according pixel values (for the new 3ds xl that's 320 pixels of height and 240 pixels of width). the values might seem weird because the screens used in 3ds consoles are portrait screens rotated 90deg.
